            <br>
            <img class="tips-img" src="/assets/guides/intro.jpg" alt="">
            <p>So you decided to play Bleach Immortal Soul and you are just starting out The Game, Then you are in the right place!
                <br>
                <br>
                Bleach Immortal Soul is a free-to play RPG for Android and iOS devices with a gatcha system. It is a turn-based strategy gameplay. The game itslef has the original voice characters of the anime adapatation of Bleach and also the orignal manga artist "Tite Kubo"'s artwork which is what brought most of the Bleach Fans to this game. The Goal of this game is to build strong teams through unlocking new characters from the Main Story or various Events and Shops in the game.
                <br>
                Bleach Immortal Soul offers a Tutorial when starting the game that you cannot skip. It will guide you through the basics of the game and the combat system. We highly recommend you to pay close attention to the game instructions to get familiar with it.
            </p>
            <ul class="topmust">
            <li><h3>Rule number 1 !</h3></li>
            <br>
            <p>The number 1 goal in this game is to have Fun after all, There is lots of content available for the players wether you are a Fan of Bleach or not, Odds are you will find somethings you like about this game. You will be unlocking different game modes and options as you Level up in addition to the seasonal events. Your main focus would be the Story mode which we will cover next.</p>
            <br>
            <li><h3>Story Mode</h3></li>
            <img class="tips-img" src="/assets/guides/story.jpg" alt="">

            <p>The Story mode is the main game mode through which you will progress in Bleach: Immortal Soul, which means that, at least at the beginning, it’s what you’ll be focusing on for the most part. This mode is also where you’ll experience most of the story in the game, which is directly based on the narratives and arcs from the show. In the Story mode you will also be learning about the game's fundamentals and combat system</p>
            <p>By playing this main campaign mode, you will be using Stamina which is located on the top right of your screen. Story Missions require 6 Stamina to play and each Chapter has 10 missions. It is important how you manage your stamina in this game since you only get a certain amount of Stamina a day unless if you purchase some Bento Boxes which gives you 50 stamina.
            <br>
            <img class="tips-img" src="/assets/guides/exploration.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
                If your Stamina is full and you do not use it then the game has a cool system where it acumulate the stamina that you have not used and by pressing the Idle Exploration menu you can use Quick Explore and use up all the stamina that was stored, though there is a limit of how much stamina you can store.</p>
            <p>As you progress through the Story mode certain Chapters are only unlocked when you reach a certain level, this is to give players a chance to enjoy the other modes available in the game until you unlock the next Chapter in the Story.</p>

            <li><h3>Team Composition</h3></li>
            
            <img class="tips-img" src="/assets/guides/teamcomp.jpg" alt="">
          
            <p>This what the the team formation menu looks like. You can deploy 6 Characters for the Story Mode, 9 Characters for the Elite Mode, where 3 Characters in the back will assist you with their Rage Skill Attack in the fight and 9 Character as well for the PvP mode.
                <br>
                On the top left of the Sreen we see 4 different symbols , From top to bottom :
                
                <br>
                Azure Dragons
                <br>
                Tiger Soul   
                <br>
                Vermilion bird
                <br>
                Black Tortoise
                <br>
                Every character in the game belongs to one of those 4 Halls, and having 2 or 4 characters from the same Hall gives your Team a Bonus, You can find more information about each Hall in the Soul Hall. The best aproach to this is to keep your team balanced and have at least a bonus from 2 halls in your team.
                <br> 
                Along with that, We have Character types. Next to each Character you can see a sword, a shield or a boot. That is mainly the character's speciality. Attacker, Tank, Support (Some Support and Tank Characters are also great Damage Dealers so don't limit yourself into just their Type to chose their Role in your team). We have resources in this website to help you chose what characters are best for your team, such as the characters tier list. It is best to get to know your characters as well and read their sheets Because every character has his own unique bonuses outside of their Hall and Speciality. So choose wisely your formation to your own heart's content and playstyle. 
                <br>
                Hint: <i>You can change your team formation Most of the time before every fight, so use that to adapt to every situation.</i> 
            </p>
            <li><h3>Game Modes</h3></li>
<br>
            <h4>PVE</h4>
          
            <img class="tips-img" src="/assets/guides/pve.jpg" alt="">
          
            <p>1 . The Sereitei Challenge is available every other day. It's a PVE mode where the objective is  to clear 3 floors in 48 Hours with a team of 6 that is interchangeable inside the Challenge. Each floor has it's own path with multiple stages choices and at the end of each floor there will be a final Fight to move on to the next floor and a Treasure. You are given a choice after each Combat won, between 3 bonuses that would help your team for the rest of the Seireitei Challenge, Choose Wisely The bonuses that would benefit you the most in your current team such as Bonus Attack to all Azure Characters etc.. <br> <i>After clearing Chapter 15-1 in the Story Mode you will Unlock Seireitei Challenge Nightmare Mode.</i> </p>
            <br>
            <p>2. Soul Society Orders is a dispatch mode, where you deploy characters from your collection into missions daily and get rewards. The characters have to fill the requirements of the mission before you deploy them such as the Enhacement level, Hall Type. This is most likely what you will be doing first everyday since it takes about 4 hours for your characters to return from their missions and collect their rewards.</p>
            <br>
            <p>3. The Extreme Challenge is the mode that can test your limits and how far your strongest formation can go. The rewards are pretty sweet, especially every 5th and 10th floor. Try it out and keep trying till you get it ! Later in the game more Extreme challenge modes will be made available to you.</p>
            <br>

           <h4>Elite Mode</h4>

            <img class="tips-img" src="/assets/guides/elite.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            <p>The elite mode is another PVE mode made to farm scrolls, which is the material required to upgrade equipments and a rare chance to get character shards. It is not recommended to use this mode to farm Character shards since the chances are very low and each try costs you 12 Stamina. You may use 9 Characters here but as specified in the Team Composition Section, The back 3 Characters Will only use their Rage skills to assit you in the combat. If you clear the Stage with 0 or 1 death in your team then you can sweep that stage later on without having to play it again.</p>
<br>
            <h5>The PVP Modes Will Have a different section since it's a whole new Topic and we would like to give you a proper Guidance to the game. Feel Free to explore them now until we update our Site with the PVP section.</h5>
