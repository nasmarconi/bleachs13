            <h4 class="title-guide">BLEACH IMMORTAL SOUL PRO TIPS</h4>
            <br>
            <p>In this section we are going to be talking about the most important aspects of the game you have to pay attention to. You may follow these tips at any point of the game you're in. The earlier you follow these tips the better results you get in the long run ! If you are Freshly starting out the game, we recommend you visit the Starter Guide First <a href="/starter-guide.html">Here</a>
            <br>
            <br>
                Considering you have already completed the Story mode Tutorial and went through the Starter Guide, you understand how the game works or at least have an idea of where everything is. These are the Top Priorities according to the Top players and Overall Community.
            </p>
            <ul class="topmust">
            <li><h3>1. Enjoy the "<i>Long Game</i> " </h3></li>
            <br>
            <p>If you are playing Bleach Immortal Soul, then you are most likely a fan of the Anime series right? Then enjoy the game and take your time into making your decisions and upgrades. This game is a survival game. That's right, There is no need to be pouring your money to get all characters and items. In fact most people that do end up giving up on the game after few months, because they get bored after dominating the server for a while and getting what they want right away, or they find another player pouring more money than them! Remember that there will always be someone else spending more money. This is a Gatcha game so expect that kind of players in your server and don't let it affect you, play the game in your own rythm.</p>
            <br>
            <li><h3>2. Soul Hall</h3></li>
            <img class="tips-img" src="/assets/soulhall.jpg" alt="">

            <p>The Soul Hall is considered one of the areas that gives the most stats bonuses to your characters overall.
            <br>
        The best option is to Level up the characters in the Soul Hall all Equally to get the most profit from your Mettalurgy Crystals. As you level up your characters, they cost more and more to upgrade, therefore you lose bonuses you can get from leveling up other characters. Your team at the moment when you are in your first months of playing may not be fully optimized to deal the most damages etc.. but after the first couples of months You will start noticing the changes from all the % bonuses you are getting from the Soul Hall.</p>
        <br>  
            <li><h3>3. Talents</h3></li>
            
            <img class="tips-img" src="/assets/talents.jpg" alt="">
          
            <p>The Talents are tricky and you have to be careful with what talents to upgrade since they cost you character shards to upgrade. So your decision is between either saving those shards to Upgrade the character, Use them to unlock the Volatile War Soul, or Use them to Upgrade the talents.
                <br>
                Here is the best approach to this :
                <br>
                When checking the talent of a character, First look at what the bonus is. Is it a bonus that benefits all your characters or is it going to benefit your characters only inside the Seireitei Challenge etc.. The Bonuses you are looking for to benefit your characters the most are the ones that increase your stats in general, for Example : Chad's Talent [Recover Stamina every hour] or Sassakibe's [Mastery Skill damage is increased by %] are top most Talents to upgrade since you are not going to be using the Characters at all but their Talents are Great to have.
                <br>
                 After the overal stats increase Talents we looked at above, the next ones to look for are the Talents increasing your team stats in Arena and Kenpachi Contest. After that you can start focusing on the the talents that you prefer depending on what you enjoy the most in the Game, If it's a character you are currently using in your formation or planning to use in the future then only upgrade his talent to level 1 or 2 until you have that character to 5-6 stars at least with the Volatile War Soul unlocked.
            </p>
            <li><h3>4. Heroic War Souls</h3></li>
          
            <img class="tips-img" src="/assets/heroicwarsoul.jpg" style="max-width: 350px;" alt="">
          
            <p>The Heroic War Souls are surprisingly a game changer and where most players start losing points if not paid attention to. The Bonuses you get from the heroic war souls are pretty similar to the talents if not Better ! and cost you less to upgrade ! You want to take the same aproach as with the talents here. look at what bonuses would benefit your team the most, Since the Heroic War Souls only unlocks when the character is upgraded to Orange then you want to look at the bonuses before hand and have the characters with the best bonuses upgraded to the highest quality you can have them as you play the game (After Upgrading the characters you are using in your formation of course)</p>
            
            <li><h3>5. Spirit Relics</h3></li>
            <img class="tips-img" src="/assets/spiritrelic.jpg" alt="">
           
            <p>Spirit Relics are not that hard to figure out, But the benefits from doing it right can have a big Impact in your team. The best way to use your Relic Sources is to finish upgrading each Spirit Relic before moving on to the Next one. For Example :  You can Finish Ichigo's Combat Pass First, which will Upgrade Your Ichigo to UR and give Your Attack Specialty Characters +10% Crit chance and other bonuses, then Move to the next Relic, Byakuya's Kenseikan. The most important is to finish upgrading the relic you are working on before moving onto the next one. </p>
            <li><h3>6. Initiative</h3></li>
            <img class="tips-img" src="/assets/initiative.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
          
            Initiative is very important when it comes to Player Vs Player Modes, Such as Arena, Kenpachi Contest, World Championships etc.. The Player with the highest Initiative gets to go first. Therefore we came up with the best way to boost your Initiative right from the start :
            <br>
            First of all, Try to get your hands on all the characters you can get even if it's a character you are not going to use. You get the most Initiative from getting new characters, Then on the Archives Menu, Level up all your characters's Favor Equally. You can start by upgrading all your character's favor to Green (Acquaintance) then start work your way to blue etc.. This is how you get the most Initiative and stat bonuses in the long run.
            <br>There are more ways to gain Initiative such as Enhancing your characters But We leave the character enhancement to you since we talked about chosing the ones you use in your formations first and the ones that have the Heroic War Soul Bonuses you need the most above.
